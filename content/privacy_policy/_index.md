If you checkout using the website checkout, the only information collected by Caspah.com is your order information such as the type of cream and quantity and your shipping information. Your billing and credit card information DOES NOT get saved anywhere on our server or internal records. We will never possess and do not keep credit card information on file anywhere as it is only passed from our site to our merchant gateway. Your credit card information is passed from submission on our site through a secure gateway (authorize.net) and then processed by our merchant account. We do use a secure socket layer (SSL) on our website to ensure safety and privacy of personal information.


The only other information that is collected is general tracking information to help us improve our website and also any submissions made on the contact forms. Information provided on the contact forms for customer inquiries will never be used for marketing purposes and is also not stored in any database.
                
                
To opt out of any future contacts, please reply to your automatic email receipt or email contact with "REMOVE" in the subject line to be removed from our customer contact list.

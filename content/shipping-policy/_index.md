## All packaging is discreet!

All orders are shipped via the US Postal Service. Your order will be shipped within 24-48 hours of making your purchase. PayPal purchases generally are shipped faster than credit card purchases because payment is instant. All of the times given for each delivery method are estimates provided by the USPS in business days. Since we are not delivering these packages ourselves, there is no way we can guarantee delivery within these time frames although they are generally good estimate. Foreign deliveries need to take into consideration that all customs times will vary for each country so these estimated delivery times can vary drastically in countries with long customs processing times (ie. European countries).You may request a refund if your order has not yet been shipped, but you will be charged a 6.5% processing fee since processing fees are non-refundable once the order has been processed. Each order is processed at 12am EST.


## United States Shipping

We offer free shipping in the US only. If you choose to take advantage of our free shipping option, your package will be sent via USPS First Class Mail. This generally takes 3-7 business days to be delivered once shipped. Our other option for shipping is USPS Priority Mail which is not free. This generally takes 2-3 business days to be delivered once it is shipped. Remember, although these time frames are pretty accurate, these are just estimates provided to us by the USPS and are in no way guaranteed.


## International Shipping

There is no free shipping option for international purchases (outside of the United States). We will not be held responsible for any customs complications, customs fees, additional shipping fees, or import taxes as there is no way for us to know how each country's postal system works. Please gain knowledge of how international shipping is received in your country before you place an order if you are unsure how your postal system works. If the package is sent back, you will be refunded appropriately minus our original shipping charges and merchant processing fees if you do not want it reshipped. International shipping options consist of USPS Priority Mail for $15.95 which is estimated by the USPS at 6-10 business days once shipped or USPS Express Mail for $34.95 which generally takes 3-5 business days once shipped. USPS Express Mail is the only service that will track online from the USA to another country and is our recommended shipping option for international orders especially if you are concerned that your country does not have the best postal system. USPS Priority mail tracking links will track only it until the package leaves the US and when it re-enters the US if it is returned.

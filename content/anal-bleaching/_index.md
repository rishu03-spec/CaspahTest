heading1: "Are you shopping for an at home anal bleaching cream?"
description1: "Caspah has a safe and gentle solution that does not contain the potentially cancerous ingredient hydroquinone or mercury and is proven to lighten effectively without causing irritation. Many companies try to sell their regular lightening creams as an anal bleach cream because they simply do not care about their customers. Regular bleaching creams can irritate the area around the anus or vagina so it is important to find an intimate lightening cream that is specifically made for anal bleaching, vaginal bleaching, and nipple bleaching."

heading2: "Directions"
description2: "First off, make sure the application area is clean and dry. Next, massage the cream into the skin surrounding the anus, vagina, or directly on the nipple. Please make sure to apply to it externally only and rub into the skin until it is completely absorbed. To achieve the best results, do this twice a day (once in the morning and once at night). For the most effective use, make sure to apply at night before bed. Once the desired skin tone is reached, you may stop use. Store the bleach cream in a dry, cool area, protected from sunlight, humidity and heat. If the area that has been treated will be exposed to sunlight for long periods of time, it is best to use an SPF 30+ sun block on the area to keep the sunlight from causing the skin to naturally darken. Do not use on broken skin or open wounds. Do not use if pregnant or breast feeding. Keep out of eyes. For external use only."

I saw results in my intimate area. Dark spots that I use to hate are visibly fading away and I grew so much more confidence. I can't wait to start using my second bottle!"

testimonyComment4: "I looked all over for an anal bleaching/whitening cream, and the reviews for this company caught my eye. What stood out to me first was thee great price for the amount provided, and after reading more reviews I decided to try it out. WOW, you're intimate lightening cream worked stupendously! I wanted to lighten up that area for personal and self-esteem reasons, and your product did just that. It was gentle on my skin; in fact it even made the skin down there feel smoother as if I was moisturizing. I have already recommended this product to friends! Caspah, you're dedication and research to your product shows not only in its effectiveness, but also in the guarantee you offer, a guarantee that let me know you stand behind what you offer. Thank you Caspah!"

heading1: Looking for a safe and effective vaginal bleaching cream?
description1: Our intimate lightening cream can be used to lighten or whiten both
  the vagina and anus areas and even the nipples. It is important to find a product
  that does not contain the ingredient hydroquinone for such senstive areas because
  it has shown to be carcinogenic and is not gentle on the skin at all. Here at Caspah
  we have created the perfect cream for vaginal bleaching. Not only is it affordable,
  but it works very well. We encourage you to do your research and we stand behind
  our products 100%. Read reviews and vaginal bleach comparisons below.
heading2: Directions
description2: Please clean the area you would like to lighten first and then dry it
  thoroughly. Next, pump some cream out of the bottle and rub it into the area around
  the vagina that you wish to lighten. Please make sure to rub it in well enough that
  the skin absorbs the cream well. If you did not cover the entire area you are trying
  to lighten, please repeat this process until you have done it on all areas. We recommend
  repeating this process twice a day to get the best results. You should do it once
  in the morning and more importantly, once before bed time. You can do this until
  you have reached your desired skin tone and then stop use. If the area you are treating
  is going to be exposed to direct sunlight or tanning bed lights for a good amount
  of time, you should apply SPF 30+ sunblock on the treated area. Just make sure the
  lightening cream is already absorbed into the skin before applying sunblock. This
  will help the skin to keep from naturally getting darker from the UV rays. Do not
  use the cream on any area with broken skin or open wounds. Do not use if pregnant
  or breast feeding. It is for external use only. Keep uut of eyes.

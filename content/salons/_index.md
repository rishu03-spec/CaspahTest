## Skin Bleaching Salons

Many salons and skin care doctors in the United States and all around the world offer skin lightening treatments as a service or at least retail specialized "do it yourself" skin lightening products to use in the privacy of your own home.

We are currently working on developing business relationships with salons around the world so customers will be able to purchase Caspah at a local retail outlet if they do not wish to purchase online. We will list the salons on this web page as we develop these relationships so please check back to see if you can purchase at a salon near you.

## Business Owners

If you are a salon or store owner interested in retailing any Caspah products, please contact us to discuss this further. Caspah products retail on average for $39.95 - $49.95 in the United States and for as much as $69.95 in other countries around the world.

If you are a customer interested in purchasing Caspah now, you may order online through our SSL secured website or checkout using PayPal. We do ship world wide. Click here to order and select which product you are interested in at the top right of the page.

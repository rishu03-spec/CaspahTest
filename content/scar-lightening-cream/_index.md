  Ever want to get rid of old dark colored scars? Now you can with Caspah Scar Lightening Cream. Designed specifically to lighten the appearance of unwanted scars that blemish the skin, Caspah has made a safe and effective solution. Many people have run into different circumstances in their lives such as random accidents, bad acne in the past, plastic surgery, or other operations that have left scars on their skin that remind them of this incident. By lightening this area to be more even with your skin tone there will be much less of a reminder. With our cream, you can even out the skin tone, fade, and lighten the old dark scar tissue area so it is less noticeable without the use of harsh chemicals that irritate the skin as many other skin lighteners contain. Using Caspah as a scar treatment, you will never have to worry about the appearance of those bothersome scars again.
  Types of scars you might use our cream on:
text2: <b style="color:#000000;">Directions:</b> Apply the scar lightening cream directly
  on the completely healed scar and rub until it is absorbed by the skin. For best
  results, do this twice a day (one time being before bed). Use a q-tip if necessary
  to get as little as possible on the surrounding skin of the scar. Once the skin
  is lightened to the preferred skin tone you can stop use. Store in an area that
  is dry, cool, and away from sunlight. If you will be exposed to sunlight for an
  extended period of time, make sure Caspah has absorbed into the skin and the area
  is dry and then apply an SPF 30+ sun block to the area in which Caspah was applied.
  Please keep away from your eyes. For external use only.

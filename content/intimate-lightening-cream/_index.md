text1: "Caspah realized the trend of anal bleaching, vaginal bleaching, and nipple bleaching years ago. This allowed us to hit the scene early and have years of testing and development long before our competitors. This is why our intimate area bleaching cream is the best on the market and has been used by many very popular people in the world of beauty and entertainment. Our product has been engineered to show amazing results, but also be gentle on the skin. It contains safe and natural ingredients containing no hydroquinone, mercury, parabens, or perfumes so there is no skin irritation on these sensitive areas. Many people have an odd skin discoloration on their private areas surrounding the anus, vagina, or irregularly dark nipples compared to their skin tone. Caspah Intimate Lightening Cream evens those discolored areas to match their skin tone so they're not so noticeable anymore. People of all ethnicities tend to experience these discolorations. Caspah works for all skin types."

text2: "<b style=\"color:#000000;\">Directions:</b> Make sure the application area is clean and dry. Apply Caspah cream to the intimate area of choice externally only and rub into the skin until it is completely absorbed. Do this twice daily for best results. For the most effective use, make sure to apply once in the morning and once at night before bed. To speed up the removal of old dead skin cells quicker, you may use a loofah in the shower. Store in a dry, cool area, protected from sunlight, humidity and heat. If the area will be exposed to sunlight for long periods of time, use an SPF 30+ sun block on the area. Do not use on broken skin or open wounds. Do not use if pregnant or breast feeding. For external use only."

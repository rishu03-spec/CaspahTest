  Many people have blemishes, birthmarks, or other skin discolorations on different parts of the body that they are unhappy with. For this reason, Caspah developed a powerful lightening cream to specifically to help lighten these areas of uneven skin pigmentation to reduce their obvious appearance. Some people are born with these skin discolorations and others develop them over time due to things such as pregnancy, age, or other medical conditions. Our solution is gentle, natural, safe, and does not contain the harmful, potentially cancer causing lightening ingredient, hydroquinone. It also does not contain any perfumes, parabens or mercury. With a simple twice a day application of Caspah bleaching cream to the discolored or dark skin, the appearance of these blemishes will diminish fast.

We are so confident in our products from our testing, research, and past clients, that we offer an amazing 45 day refund policy. You have 45 days from your original purchase date to send the product back to us. If you are you are unhappy with the results after the purchase of your product, you can return the product for a refund (see below). We make sure to give you plenty of time to see the results of our product. 45 from the purchase date should be more than enough time to see visual results from the product if you are applying as directed.

## RMA Number Required For All Refunds

Before shipping anything back to us you must first contact us using the contact form on our website and request an RMA number for your return package. Every return must include the RMA# on the outside of the package. We will not open packages to search for an RMA# because then they can't be returned to sender. If you send the package back without an RMA number, your package will be returned to sender until you have followed directions and request an RMA numbe

## Domestic Purchases (United States)

For a refund, all you have to do is mail back the original bottle to us and we will refund you in full, minus a $10/bottle restocking fee and whatever it costs you to mail it back. If you originally took advantage of our free shipping discount, then you will be responsible for an additional $5.e.

## International Purchases (outside the United States)

For a refund, you will need to mail back the original bottle to us and we will refund you in full, minus a $10/bottle restocking fee.

## General Information

The restocking fee would just come out of the balance of the refund. Please make sure to put tracking on your package because we will need to receive your bottle in order to give a refund. If we do not receive your bottle, we will not issue a refund. All refunds have to go back to the original card or PayPal account used to purchase the order. For any refund requested before initial shipment, you will be refunded in full minus a 7% merchant processing fee for domestic orders and a 10% merchant processing fee for international orders because these fees are non-refundable to all parties. However, if you use PayPal for payment, we can refund in full without processing fees as PayPal does not charge them on refunded purchases. We do say to allow 24-48 hours processing time before shipment is made, but occasionally some shipments are made the same day as the purchase depending on the time of day as we try to provide very fast shipping.

Our 45 day refund policy applies to first time buyers only and to a maximum of up to (3) bottles. You must purchase your bottle directly from this website in order to qualify for a refund. Also, please note that our system will not allow the refund to be processed after 45 days from the original purchase, so you must request an RMA and have it back to our company within 45 days from the original purchase.

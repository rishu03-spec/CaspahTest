  I just wanted to send you a message to thank you. I used Caspah to lighten a really
  blatant scar from the c-section I had after giving birth to my son. I applied it
  as I was directed to do by your customer service person that I emailed and am very
  impressed with my result. I am very satisfied with the end result. I would recommend
  this cream to anyone looking to lighten a c-section scar.<i class="fa fa-quote-right
